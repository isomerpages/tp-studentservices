# Skills Upgrading and Mastery
The Temasek SkillsFuture Academy (TSA) is committed to the SkillsFuture initiatives and the professional development of adult learners.
 

Our wide range of part-time courses are organised into six Industry Transformation Map (ITM)* clusters and their respective industries, providing adult learners with the relevant skills and valuable knowledge to meet the challenges of the future economy.

**Singaporeâ€™s Ministry of Trade and Industry introduced the ITMs to drive industry transformation.*
