The Student Services caters specifically to the needs of our students and alumni. It offers a wide range of services relating to student academic matters and enquiries. Self-service notebooks are available for students to login to access to TP's various online services, such as retrieval of class timetable and examination results, registration for graduation ceremonies and booking of sports and library facilities.
