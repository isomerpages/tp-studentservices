Welcome, Freshmen!

Congratulations on your successful enrolment to Temasek Polytechnic! Due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation in Singapore, your learning journey in TP will commence with the TP Freshmen Orientation Programme that has been designed and prepared specially for you.

It is essential that you set aside time and attend the Freshmen Orientation Programme.

During these sessions, you will:

* Meet your Care Persons
* Meet your classmates from the same course
* Get to understand about your course and its requirements
* Orientate yourself with the TP environment
* Receive your student matriculation card and learn how to read your timetable
* Learn how to use TPâ€™s Brightspace Learning Management System (LMS) to access your lectures and tutorials online
* These sessions, scheduled from 4 to 14 April 2022, will give you a head start into the new semester. You will only need to come to TP on your allocated session date. Please bring along your laptop to the session so that you can practice logging in to the Brightspace LMS and check if you can access your learning materials.

Details of your Freshmen Orientation Programme (time and venue) will be communicated to you via mail, email or SMS. Your safety and well-being is our utmost priority. At TP, we have a zero tolerance policy on hazing and derogatory behaviour. You are encouraged to report such incidents to any TP staff or via our whistle blower hotline at sdaa@tp.edu.sg.
